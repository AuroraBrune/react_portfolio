                <div class="col-lg-2"> I'm Aurora Brune a Full-Stack Web Developer. I recently graduated from the
                University of Kansas Coding Bootcamp. I grew up as a Military dependent in a large family. My father served in
                the Air Force and I joined the Air Force after High School. I worked on Aircraft maintaining and
                troubleshooting Avionics on C-5 and C-141 aircraft, which is comparable to debugging. A problem solver, math and
                science person who loves the outdoors and gardening.

                <div class="col-lg-2">Currently, a Special Education Paraprofessional for 18 years and additionally, for last
                several years, I
                also worked a second position for the city's Parks and Recreation Department as Program Director of the After
                School/Summer Day Camp.
                Not afraid to take responsibities, I grew this program to a current enrollment of over 80, with up to 33 staff
                members over the busy
                Summer Day Camp season. Working these two jobs has been rewarding and challenging, but with the recent events
                transpiring from
                Covid-19 virus, like for many individuals, both of these positions have been severely impacted.

                <div class="col-lg-2">This leads me to KU Coding Bootcamp program. I feel coding can tap into my existing
                skillsets;
                analyzing, correcting and developing existing systems while coaching and mentoring young talent. This new career
                opporunity allows me
                to reuse my existing skills and build my knowledge base of technology for the benefit of my future employer. I
                find programming is
                challenging and rewarding, especially when I find a solution learning new ways to improve code for a project. I
                hope to work on a
                team to share in their knowledge and responsibities. Thank you.
